test_mcp_server.py

Import-level regression tests for tscode_kg.mcp_server.

The MCP server builds its ``FastMCP`` instance and registers every tool with
module-level decorators, so an incompatible ``mcp`` release breaks it at
*import* time rather than at call time — and only for people who installed
from PyPI, since a developer's pinned lock file keeps working.

mcp 2.0 removed the bundled ``mcp.server.fastmcp`` module (FastMCP was split
out into the standalone ``fastmcp`` package), which makes the import at
``mcp_server.py`` line 81 fail outright. `pyproject.toml` pins ``mcp<2`` for
that reason; these tests fail loudly if the pin is lifted without porting the
server, instead of shipping a broken console script.

``mcp`` lives in the ``kg`` extra, so these skip when it is absent entirely.
They still fail — rather than skip — when ``mcp`` is installed at the wrong
major, which is the case that matters.

Ported from pycode_kg's ``tests/test_mcp_server.py``.
