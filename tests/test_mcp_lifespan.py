"""The MCP server's lifespan hook closes the graph's SQLite connection on
shutdown -- the resource-cleanup pattern genealogy_kg set and kgrag_priv's
FLEET_STANDARDS.md records (sweep item 5). FastMCP's ``lifespan=`` fires on
both the stdio and SSE transports, since both route through the same
underlying ``Server.run()``.

Drives the real server through ``mcp.shared.memory``'s in-process transport:
an actual ``Server.run()``/lifespan cycle, not a mock of ``close``.
