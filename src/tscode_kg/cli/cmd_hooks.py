# TypeScriptKG pre-commit hook — runs quality checks. The index rebuild and
# metrics snapshot are opt-in and OFF by default; see "Why snapshots are off".
# Installed by: tscodekg install-hooks
#
#   TSCODEKG_SNAPSHOT=1 git commit ...        opt in to a per-commit snapshot
#   TSCODEKG_SKIP_SNAPSHOT=1 git commit ...   force snapshots off (wins)
#
# Note that TSCODEKG_SKIP_SNAPSHOT no longer skips the quality checks. It used
# to short-circuit the whole hook, so a variable named "skip snapshot" also
# silently skipped ruff, ty and pytest. It now gates only what it names.
#
# Why snapshots are off by default (2026-08-18)
# ---------------------------------------------
# A per-commit snapshot records `git write-tree` and is then itself staged into
# that same commit. Staging changes the index, so the recorded hash can never
# equal the tree it claims to describe — and manifest.json carries a
# `last_update` timestamp, so the `git add` is never a no-op. The drift is
# guaranteed by construction, not caused by formatting.
#
# An audit of 605 snapshots across 29 fleet manifests found 63 (10.4%) keyed to
# a tree any commit actually has. `snapshot diff` between adjacent entries has
# therefore been comparing states that never existed.
#
# The fix is to snapshot at release, keyed on the tag rather than on an
# ephemeral pre-commit tree. See kgrag_priv/docs/SNAPSHOT_STRATEGY.md. Until
# that lands, this hook runs quality checks only.
#
# This hook also used to run the rebuild and snapshot BEFORE the quality
# checks, which is the opposite of what it should do:
#
#   * `pre-commit run` stashes unstaged changes and restores them afterwards.
#     Building first meant the freshly-rewritten snapshots/manifest.json landed
#     inside the stash window, where the restore could fail with "patch does not
#     apply" and abort the commit outright — or, worse, let a staged deletion of
#     a tracked snapshot slip into the commit.
#   * There is no reason to pay for an index rebuild on a commit that
#     ruff/ty/pytest is about to reject.
